# Random-Name-Generator

You are to build out a Random Name Generator.

Pulling in data from a local JSON file, you will create a designed Random Name Generator.
Have your application themed and make sure your list of names is the class plus the Instructors.

You also need to have a section that shows the previous 5 names that were pulled from your Random Name Generator.
Don't forget to have fun!!!

Comments: The code runs smoothly and keeps the previous 5 names that were generated. It does look a little bit weird with a ton of bullet points for each section but other than that it all runs perfect. I noticed you use a bunch of if statements in your function as well which was something that I had not thought of doing for mine. Good Job Overall!
